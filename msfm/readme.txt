MORE STYLE FOR MAGES - README
Originally, this mod aimed to make mages in the game to appear more stylish. For that end it adds mage-specific staffs with ranged attacks and circlets, plus it also tweaks all robes, so that player can choose their look. Then I decided to put more mage-related stuff into it, so I added familiar tweaks, familiars for NPC mages, wand case and tweaks for the Staff of the Magi. More stuff might come in the future.

Wizard’s Staff for BG:EE
There are two options here. The first one adds 7 Staffs with unique animation and +1 enchantment, to the High Hedge stock and Xithiss in the Black Pits, after the first upgrade of his stock. Each one has different color, mainly to fit different color styles of NPC mages. The second one add 6 staffs into those shops, and each one can be customized through the item abilities menu with 14 possible color choices (this option is newer, but I decided to let the old colorsets in too).

Staff of Wizardry for BG2:EE
This component adds 7 Staffs with unique animation into the store of Garlena, the helmite on the top of Watcer's Keep. She can be accessed from both SoA and ToB. These Staffs have both ranged and melee attacks and you can switch between them. Since version 1.3, they are also available in the Black Pits 2, in the stock of the un-named Illithid. These staffs can be customized through the item abilities menu with 14 possible color choices.
In BG2, they are called Staffs of Wizardry and are +3 weapons. But the main difference from BG1 is, that I decided to expand an ambition of this mod a bit and include the problematic area of specialist mages. Each of the staffs can be further empowered, when its wielder reaches 250 000 XP in total, by clicking on a button "activate" in the item description screen. If it's wielded by a specialist mage, staff will be imprinted with his specialization, receiving additional school-based abilities (the list of abilities
is below). When a pure mage activates the staff, he will be given a choice to either empower the staff universally, or to choose any specialization (including wild magic), which will turn him into the respective specialist and imbue the weapon with respective specialization. This is mainly to allow dual and multi-class mages to specialize in-game. Sorcerers can only choose to empower the staff universally. Warning: Note that if you are dual-classing from a kit, you will loose that kit with all its powers and become a specialist, with original pure class. Also, when you become a specialist this way, all spells from the forbidden school will be erased from your spell book, and all your memorized spells will be drained in the process. So you better do this before resting. This doesn't apply to wild mage.
Activated staffs have following abilities:
Staff of Abjuration - 25% chance of casting Spell Thrust, on successful hit - can cast Minor Spell Turning once per day
Staff of Conjuration - 25% chance of casting Summon Insect, on successful hit (like the priest spell) - can cast Monster Summoning III once per day
Staff of Divination - 25% chance of casting Know Enemy, on successful hit Know Enemy: Lowers AC, THACO and saving throws at -3 each for 10 rounds - can cast Oracle once per day
Staff of Enchantment - 25% chance of casting Rigid Thinking, on successful hit - can cast Hold Monster once per day
taff of Illusions - 25% chance of casting Sensory Collapse, on successful hit Sensory Collapse: Target is effected by Blindness and Deafness for 10 rounds (Save vs. Spell negates the effect) - can cast Shadow Door once per day
Staff of Invocation - 25% chance of casting Lightning Bolt, on successful hit (only effects the target) - can cast Cloudkill once per day
Staff of Necromancy - 25% chance of casting Vampiric Touch, on successful hit - can cast Animate Dead once per day
Staff of Alternation - 25% chance of casting Slow, on successful hit - can cast Phase Shift once per day (similar to Dimension Door, but is cast instantly)
Staff of Wild Magic - 24% chance of casting one of the "on hit" spells of the other staffs, on successful hit - can cast Wildstrike once per day Wildstrike: All spellcasting of the target is effected by wild surges in next 5 rounds
Staff of Dragon Power - 25% chance of casting Wing Buffet, on successful hit (throws target back, uncouscious for one round, 2d8+4 crushing damage) - can cast Dragon Fear once per day Dragon Fear: All enemies within 40 ft. Radius must Save vs. Spell with -4 penalty or flee in terror. Some creatures are immune to the effects of fear, including all undead. Staff of Wizardry (Empowered) - Wielder can cast any 5th-level spell, once per day
Since version 1.3, Staffs of Wizardry can be upgraded by Cespenar in ToB. There are seven gems called "Shard of Netheril" scattered in ToB maps, which can be combined with Staffs of Wizardry. Upgraded staffs have +5 enchantment and have increased on-hit chance to cast spell to 35%. They also gain one additional 8th-level spell (Note that this spell doesn't have tooltip, since maximum of tooltips for an item has been exceeded, so the tooltip displays only the name of the staff. However, when spell is cast, it shows proper name in the dialog window.)
Additional spells are:
-Staff of Abjuration +5: Pierce Shield
-Staff of Conjuration +5: Summon Fire Giant Summon Fire Giant: Summons one Fire Giant, which is under complete control of the party for 15 rounds or until it’s slained.
-Staff of Divination +5: Prediction Prediction: Caster gets bonus to +6 AC, -6 to THACO, +3 to saves and becomes immune to backstab and normal missiles, for 5 rounds.
-Staff of Enchantment +5: Thrall Thrall: If failed save vs. spell at -2 penalty, target is permanently under complete control of the caster and acts as a party member. This spell also ignores mind shielding protections.
-Staff of Illusions +5: Simulacrum
-Staff of Invocation +5: Incendiary Cloud
-Staff of Necromancy +5: Abi-Dalzim's Horrid Wilting
-Staff of Alternation +5: Mass Polymorph Other Mass Polymorph Other: Same as Polymoprh Other spell, but covers 30 ft. area and all enemies must save vs. spell at -2 penalty.
-Staff of Wild Magic +5: Wild Sphere Wild Sphere: All creatures within 30 ft. area are affected with wild surges for 5 rounds
-Staff of Dragon Power +5: Lesser Dragon Form Lesser Dragon Form: For 2 turns, caster is transformed into a small dragon and receives substantial melee bonuses. This spell uses Red Abishai animation from PST provided for EEs by viader and his Extended Animations Resource Pack. -Staff of Wizardry +5: Wielder may cast any 8th-level spell once per day

Staff of Wizardry for IWD:EE
Staffs of Wizardry for IWD:EE are very similar as for BG2:EE. The differences are, that the staffs (which are available in Orrick's shop) are only of +1 enchantment when bought and they will get to +3 only after the "activation" when the wielder is over 250 000 XP. Then, the staff can be upgraded to +5 the same way, when he reaches 1 000 000 XP. All spells and abilities remain same.

Custom inventory animation for SoW
This component has been rendered somewhat obsolete, because unlike BG:EE, there are now original inventory animations for these staffs, as the game uses the animation for the Staff of the Magi and Staff of Ram. Still, you can choose between the original, and the custom, that I made for BG:EE. If you install this component, custom will override the original, if you don't install, you will have the original.

Staff of the Magi with ranged attack and custom tweaks
Firstly, this component adds ranged attack to the Staff of the Magi. You can choose melee or ranged the same way as it works for Staffs of Wizardry. The projectile has yellow color.
Secondly, I decided to add an optional tweaks to it, that change the equipped invisibility to something else, so that doesn’t tempt to exploit re-equipping all the time. Ranged attack is added to each choice.
Choices are following:
-keep original
-remove invisibility
-replace invisibility with 50% magic resistance
-replace invisibility with immunity to time stop
-replace invisibility with increased casting speed by -3
-replace invisibility with restoring one spell up to level 5 each hour (higher spell level is restored first)

Circlets
In BG1, circlets already exist in the game files, with proper names and descriptions, so I merely put them in Thalantyr's stock (and to Xithiss in BP as well). They have (tiny) paperdoll animations, but they were missing inventory animations, which again I drew for them. In BG2, these circlets are not within the game files anymore, so I took them unchanged from BG1 and put them into the stock of Garlena, the helmite, on the top of Watcher's Keep. Only Circlet of the Archmagi and Eilistraee's Boon +1 were added. Unlike BG:EE, circlets have original inventory animations. In IWD, Circlet of the Archmagi and Eilistraee's Boon +1 are added to Orrick's shop.

Circlet of Revelation for BG:EE
This item allows mages to become specialists the same way as Staffs of Wizardry in BG2 work. But because Wizard's Staffs in BG1 don't offer such option, I made this one to make it possible in BG1. The circlet is available in Thalantyr's stock and can be used multiple times. But it only works for non-specialist mages (including dual and multis), so once mage becomes a specialist, he cannot use it to change his specialization. The effect is permanent.

Wizard's hat
This component adds a Wizard's hat. An item with some magical properties and completely new custom animation made by @Smiley for human male mages and sorcerers (the limit is there because the animation only exists for them).

Wand Case
This component adds a Wand Case with the storage capacity of 50 pieces to High Hedge, Garlena’s and Orrick’s shops.

Stone of teleportation
[BETA] This component adds unique artifacts into SOA and TOB campaigns, which allow the whole party to be instantly teleported to previously visited surface areas. The effect does not work at plot critical places, such as Spellhold, Underdark etc. The component is currently in a beta state, because I didn't test it through the whole game. Use it with caution, it is theoretically possible to skip plot critical triggers.
In the below spoiler is the location of the artifact in both campaigns:
SPOILER:Inside chest in Umar Hills cave and inside chest in Amkethran smuggler cave

Visual Tweaks for Robes
Robe tweaks section doesn't add new items, but only tweaks existing robes. It gives them the ability to switch between all three possible visual types (no hood and no cape, no hood with cape, hooded
with cape) via item abilities. Every robe then looks as original by default, but has two item abilities, which can change their looks to the other 2 visual types. This allows to set the favourite look for your wizard (and overcome some graphical glitches - elven female horribly colored leg comes to mind...). Robe tweaks come in two versions. One version keeps all original set colors of robes and the other removes them, which makes them use character's colors instead. Note, that as a side effect, I had to make all robes automatically identified.
This component patches the mage robes, so it is compatible with mods that alter them. You must install this mod after such mods, however.

Colorsets for Robes of the Archmagi from Cosmetic Changes Mod
This component allows you to enjoy the custom colorsets for Robes of Archimagi made by Dee in his Mr. Pennyway's Cosmetic Changes mod.

Customizable familiars
When a protagonist casts Find Familiar, a dialog window will trigger, where he will be able to choose its race, class and a name.
The race options are:
Drake
Imp (for evil) or Mephit (good and neutral)
Cat
Rabbit
Groundhog
Small spider
Lim-Lim
Floating Skull
For now, all races have the same statistics, so this is mostly just about choosing the appearance.
There are two classes to choose from – mage and a thief. A mage will get to choose up to five spells during the course of the game, each when its summoner reaches a certain amount experience. It starts with a level 1 spell, then he will gain a 3, 5, 7 and 9 level spells. A thief can similarly choose a +50% bonus to one of four basic thieving abilities. Numbers can change in the future for balance reasons. The tresholds for upgrades are:
0 XP
89 000 XP (100 000 XP for IWD:EE)
500 000 XP
2 500 000 XP
6 000 000 XP (5 000 000 XP for IWD:EE)
Upon each upgrade, the familiar also improves its hit points, AC, THACO and saving throws. Its detailed statistics are shown in the item description, when it‘s in your backpack.
There are three name slots you can choose from. It’s “Isane”, “Kailey” and default “Familiar”. In the next component you can change these names with your own.
Custom names for familiars
As written above, there are three names you can choose for your familiar. It’s “Isane”, “Kailey” and default “Familiar”. This component allows you to type your own names during the installation process. You can choose to type one, two or three names and your names will override the preset ones, so in the dialog window, you will be able to choose from your own names. There is a warning though, if you change any other mod component that you installed before, that updates game texts, the installation process will prompt you to write the names again.

Familiars for NPC mages
NPC mages can finally summon their own familiars, when they cast a Find Familiar spell. Only vanilla arcane spellcasters can summon familiars (plus Khalid, Safana and Yoshimo – if they get spellcasting
ability). NPCs cannot customize their familiars even if the above component is installed, they have preset ones. They have different races, unique names and most of them are mages, except of Yoshimo’s, which is a thief. Also, when a summoner talks to his familiar, a dialog, unique for each NPC, will trigger, at which end, the NPC will take it to his backpack. There are no more banters yet, but they may come in the future. If anyone wants to cooperate on this, they are welcomed to. Familiars get upgrades the same way as the ones from “Customizable familiars“ component.
When these familiars die, NPCs don’t loose CON point, but neither do they get a hit point bonus, when they summon it. Also, any number of familiars can be summoned at the same time, however, when you control more than seven creatures, you get messed up formation target points for the rest of them, when you move.

Animation tweaks for some familiars
The only remaining tweak resizes the Demilich animation, because the floating skull familiar uses it. So, it will make Kangaxx and the Demilich from Watcher’s Keep smaller. In BG:EE no creature uses this animation, I’m not sure about IWD:EE.

Find Familiar spell scrolls in shops
This adds more scrolls to the High Hedge, Sorcerous Sundries, Garlena and the spell merchant in the Adventurer’s Market in BG:EE and BG2:EE and to the Black Pits, so that more NPCs can cast it.
