@13=~It does not take years of study in the arcane to be able to tell that this finely crafted staff is highly enchanted.

@14=~This staff is one of the most prized possessions a wizard can acquire. Its unique design allows it to shoot bolts of pure magical energy at any target within 30 feet. It powers itself by harvesting an ambient arcane energy, that naturally emanates from magic users. As such, it will never run out of charges, but can only be used by wizards and sorcerers.

Its shape and construction is reminiscent to that of a wand of magic missiles. It has a long shaft tipped with a distinct gem emanating with magical energy. However, unlike a fragile wand, it is indestructible. Its handle, also contains a control mechanism, that enables or disables the discharge of magical bolts. Therefore it can also be used as a regular melee weapon, if needed. Otherwise, magical bolts are released with just a swing.

These staffs are quite rare on the Sword Coast and their true origins remain unknown. It is believed that they were originally devised by the mages of Netheril.

The Staff of Wizardry, which you now hold in your hands, is the pinnacle of arcane craftsmanship. A masterpiece encapsulating the knowledge, research and study of many generations of wizards. The enchantments within it, make it more than capable of damaging all foes, save for the most powerful of entities within the Realms. 

However, the most intriguing ability of the staff, is to imprint the wielder's own magical prowess into the weapon. When activated, the staff will delve into the spellcaster's aura and merge with the strongest aspect of his arcane power, granting additional school-based abilities.

STATISTICS:

Special ability:
When a wielder reaches 250 000 XP he can activate the staff with following effects:
-A specialist mage can imprint his specialization into the staff, giving it additional school-based powers.
-A generalist mage (including dual and multi-class) can either upgrade the staff, giving it additional powers, or choose any specialization, which will turn them into the respective specialists and imprint the staff the respective specialization.
The effects are permanent.

@83=~This staff is one of the most prized possessions a wizard can acquire. Its unique design allows it to shoot bolts of pure magical energy at any target within 30 feet. It powers itself by harvesting an ambient arcane energy, that naturally emanates from magic users. As such, it will never run out of charges, but can only be used by wizards and sorcerers.

Its shape and construction is reminiscent to that of a wand of magic missiles. It has a long shaft tipped with a distinct gem emanating with magical energy. However, unlike a fragile wand, it is indestructible. Its handle, also contains a control mechanism, that enables or disables the discharge of magical bolts. Therefore it can also be used as a regular melee weapon, if needed. Otherwise, magical bolts are released with just a swing.

It can also cast Spell Trap and Dispel Magic and launch a Fireball-Lightning Bolt combination. The quintessential Mage item.

@430=~Noticing a threatening tone of your voice, the familiar reluctantly gives you everything, it has stolen. "Bah, what a thief you are."~

@431=~The small creature stares quizzically with wide eyes. Nervously, it backs away towards <CHARNAME>. Obviously, it doesn't want to talk to you.~

@432=~The small creature reacts happily, when you approach it. "You wish something?" It awaits your attention.~

@433=~The familiar coos with delight, its eyes whirling as you pat it. "You are very kind to me, my <PRO_LADYLORD>," it purrs.~

@434=~The familiar looks up at you with a slightly bewildered expression. "You wish to ask *me* for advice, my <PRO_LADYLORD>?"~

@435=~It looks at the darkness for a long moment before turning its eyes back at you. "Let us be away from this dark place, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. That is my advice."~

@436=~The familiar looks about quizzically before turning its eyes back upon you. "We go to the place of the poor? The slums, my <PRO_LADYLORD>? I do not know."~

@437=~The little creature chuckles to itself musically. "You must collect gold, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. Coins and coins enough to find your answers."~

@438=~It almost seems to frown and looks around before continuing. "I do not know, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. You must continue these tasks, no?"~

@439=~It ponders for a long moment, before turning back again. "We must stop this wizard. Save you and the little sister. That is my advice."~

@440=~It looks around for a moment, its eyes dimming with fear. "We must be away from this place soon, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. Please?"~

@441=~It growls menacingly, but not at you. "The wizard, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. He must die, and you must live."~

@442=~The familiar grins with pleasure and gazes up at you. "So long as you are well, my <PRO_LADYLORD>, then I am well."~

@443=~"I... I am hurt badly, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. I don't want to die, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. I want to stay with you." The creature whimpers a little and curls around your leg.~

@444=~"I feel wonderful myself, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. I am fresh, and I stand ready to aid you against danger!"~

@445=~The familiar smiles contentedly and then turns its eyes back to the path before you. "As you wish, my <PRO_LADYLORD>."~

@446=~The little creature looks up at you for a moment. "You must survive, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. Your heritage places you in great danger!" It shakes its body agitatedly.~

@447=~For a moment, the familiar growls fiercely. "The imposter must die, my <PRO_LADYLORD>! You must somehow go into the Throne of Bhaal and confront her!"~

@448=~You offer the little creature some nuts and berries that you have stored, and it nibbles on a few of them but doesn't really seem all that hungry.~

@449=~The familiar's eyes swirl with pleasure as it noisily gulps down a large quantity of nuts and berries that you have collected. Its wounds visibly start healing immediately.~

@450=~The creature stares with open derision, then turns around while rudely commenting your appearance to itself. It scoots off to <CHARNAME>. Obviously, it doesn't want to talk to you...~

@451=~The creature regards you suspiciously, wary of a kick or slap headed its way, before sidling a step or two closer. "Yeah, boss? You want something?"~

@452=~"Oh, sure. Stick me in your smelly pack. Ever thought of putting some mint in there? Baaah..." Reluctantly, it crawls into your pack.~

@453=~It seems disgusted as you pat it on the head. "Oh, now I'm a cute little bunny? Give me a break, boss." The familiar darts away and does a heebie-jeebie dance.~

@454=~The skull shakes from one side to the other in an exaggerated fashion. "What? Now I'm your tourist guide? Do whatever you want, boss. Go kill a king or something, sheesh."~

@455=~The familiar looks about. "What? Seems like a cheery enough place. Slaughter the locals, set yourself up as absolute ruler and tyrant. Works for me."~

@456=~It looks at you suspiciously, its eyes squinting. "Hmph. Since when are you so interested in me, boss? Up 'til now, it's all been you, you, you."~

@457=~It looks at you suspiciously. "Hmph. Since when are you so interested in me, boss? Up 'til now, it's all been you, you, you."~

@458=~"But since you're asking, I could use healing. Running out of time here... you wouldn't want me to die, would you? *That* would be a shame..."~

@459=~It looks ahead and sighs. "Oh, sure. Only, what, another fifty years of wanderin' around? Don't you ever settle down? Sheesh..."~

@460=~The familiar reels from the blow. "HeeEEYY! Cripes! What wuz that for?! I did everything you told me to, boss! Sheesh! Some people..."~

@461=~Another slap sends the skull to the floor, hitting it with a sound of a hollow crack. "Gaaah! Okay! You're the boss-<PRO_MANWOMAN>! YOU boss, ME just little follower! I get it!"~

@462=~The familiar darts away at the last second. "Nyah! Thhhppppfffttt! You couldn't hit the broad side of a barn! You suck!" It dashes away before a reprisal can come.~

@463=~"Oh, sure. Stick me in your smelly pack. Ever thought of sticking some mint in there? Baaah..." It reluctantly crawls in.~

@464=~It shakes its head for a moment before replying. "There's big trouble, boss. The time has come for all you Bhaalspawn. The jig's up. Time to pay the piper, you know. Just don't get cracked is all I can say about it."~

@465=~The creature grins. "Well... kill them before they kill you. That's what my grandpappy always said. Until he was, um, killed..."~

@466=~You offer the creature a piece of dried meat. It sniffs it with disgust and rolls its eyes. "I don't really need nothin' to eat, boss. Maybe if I'm wounded." With that, it unceremoniously tosses the meat behind it.~

@467=~You offer the skull a piece of dried meat. It looks at you quizzically. "I don't really need nothin' to eat, boss. As I'm undead and all that stuff, remember?"~

@468=~The wounded creature takes a piece of dried meat gingerly from your pack and gulps it down greedily. As it munches away, it looks at you askance. "This don't mean I owes you nothin', boss."~

@469=~The wounded skull takes a piece of dried meat with its teeth and gulps it down greedily. You are wondering about the nature of the process happening before you, as its wounds begin to heal. While it munches away, it looks at you askance. "This don't mean I owes you nothin', boss."~

@470=~The familiar sighs, twitching slightly with curiosity as it looks up at you. "What is it now, <PRO_MANWOMAN>? I am hungry. I wish to be petted and fed."~

@471=~"Aaaah..." Surprisingly, the skull appears to enjoy this activity. "Yees, this is good. It's been some time since I've been able to scratch myself."~

@472=~The creature looks at you, fairly close to bewildered. "Me? I suppose I have thoughts that it would amuse me to share, but would you even regard them, <PRO_MANWOMAN>?"~

@473=~The familiar thinks to itself for a few moments and then saunters away, presenting its rear to you. Apparently, it has tired of thinking.~

@474=~It thinks for a long moment and then seems to drift off, yawning widely. It stares to nowhere with its empty eye sockets. "You can always scratch me some more. That is my advice."~

@475=~It looks about balefully, holding its head down in fear. "This... is a place where I am food. I do not like this place. We should go elsewhere."~

@476=~As the skull thinks, it starts to shake with uncharacteristic ferocity. "There is only one solution, <PRO_MANWOMAN>. For you to survive, the wizard must die. That is how it must be."~

@477=~The creature seems to ponder saying something else, but eventually its attention drifts and it finds something more interesting than you elsewhere. Sauntering away, it presents its rear to you.~

@478=~The small creature rolls its eyes and sighs petulantly. "Fine. But you are very cruel to me, you know."~

@479=~The skull shakes from one side to the other with disagreement and sighs petulantly. "Fine. But you are very cruel to me, you know."~

@480=~The creature watches you, pondering. "Well... perhaps. But I would not put it past you not to keep your word. *sigh* Oh, very well. It amuses me when you beg."~

@481=~The familiar shrugs, bored. "I do not know what advice to give. The wizard is dead, you have your soul... can you not just leave?" It yawns widely. "Maybe build an army. Isn't that what you do?"~

@482=~It freezes in the air as it thinks. "It... seems to me that there is a reason that all the children of Bhaal are coming together. You must end it, I think." It looks at you suddenly. "And, of course, you must win!"~

@483=~Give me anything you have pickpocketed. Now!~

@484=~*pet the skull*~

@485=~The familiar sighs and turns its head disinterestedly to the path before you. "I would prefer to choose our path myself, but you'll no doubt want to be stubborn."~

@486=~It looks right up, seemingly content to just be near you. It sighs and looks away briefly. "We are connected, you and I. If you are well, so am I."~

@487=~I feel much stronger now.~

@488=~As it thinks, it starts to growl with uncharacteristic ferocity. "There is only one solution, <MANWOMAN>. For you to survive, this evil must die. That is how it must be."~

@489=~It looks at you with exaggerated annoyance. "What? Now I'm your tourist guide? Do whatever you want, boss. Go kill a king or something, sheesh."~

@490=~The familiar chuckles to itself musically. "If you seek adventure, my <LADYLORD>, join the caravan."~

@491=~It looks around for a moment, its eyes dimming with fear. "We need aid, my <LADYLORD>. We must press on."~

@492=~The familiar chuckles to itself musically. "We should help the Great Druid, my <LADYLORD>. He seeks the same answers."~

@493=~It ponders for a long moment, before turning back again. "Strange things are afoot in the Eye. We should investigate, my <LADYLORD>."~

@494=~It ponders for a long moment, before turning back again. "There is so much to investigate, my <LADYLORD>. I do not know where to start."~

@495=~The familiar looks about quizzically before turning its eyes back upon you. "These badges seem important, my <LADYLORD>. Perhaps there are more."~

@496=~It growls menacingly, but not at you. "We know the source of evil, my <LADYLORD>. Now we must end it."~

@497=~It almost seems to frown and looks around before continuing. "I do not know, my <LADYLORD>. We must find a way to broker peace with the tribes."~

@498=~It looks at the surroundings for a long moment before turning back at you. "We must find a way to escape this place, my <LADYLORD>. That is my advice."~

@499=~The familiar curses under its breath briefly. "Boss, that caravan may be our best bet to score some easy gold."~

@700=~A spellcaster cannot have more than one familiar at the same time.~

@701=~~

@702=~The small dragon-like creature purrs quizzically with wide eyes. Nervously, it backs away towards Aerie. Obviously, it doesn't want to talk to you.~

@703=~The small dragon-like creature flutters its wings happily, looking at Aerie with almost kaleidoscopic eyes. "You wish something?" It awaits her attention, tail flicking.~

@704=~Come here. I want to pick you up and put you in my pack, where it's a bit safer.~

@705=~Its eyes brighten, and it practically leaps into her arms, ready to be stowed amongst her belongings, where it can sleep and occasionally poke its head out.~

@706=~The imp stares with open derision, sticking out its forked tongue rudely. It scoots off to Edwin. Obviously, it doesn't want to talk to you...~

@707=~The impish creature regards Edwin suspiciously, wary of a kick or slap headed its way, before sidling a step or two closer. "Yeah, boss? You want something?"~

@708=~Come here. You're going in my pack for now.~

@709=~It rolls its eyes. "Oh, sure. Stick me in your smelly pack. Ever thought of sticking some mint in there? Baaah..." It reluctantly crawls in.~

@710=~Before you stands the most peculiar creature, that you've ever seen. Its legs are oversized, but its arms are small, nearly vestigial, and a brightly speckled half-shell runs down its back. It sports twin pairs of insect-like wings, and has tiny black eyes and a mouth that always appears to be smiling gleefully. It seems to enjoy your attention, however after a brief moment, it runs back to Haer'Dalis.~

@711=~The Lim-Lim looks up at Haer'Dalis. "Piyo! Piyo!" Its wings buzz happily when it realizes he is paying attention to it. "Piyo!"~

@712=~I am all right, thank you. Come here. I want to pick you up and put you in my pack, where it's a bit safer.~

@712=~"Piyo! Piyo!" The Lim-Lim bounces about merrily, its wings buzzing. It crawls inside his pack.~

@713=~Imoen's cat looks at you with suspicion, and after a moment's inspection, it turns and gives you full view of its rear while it strolls to her.~

@714=~The cat flicks its tail, its nose twitching slightly with curiosity as it looks up with dark eyes. "What is it, Imoen? I am hungry. I wish to be petted and fed."~

@715=~Ooh you, come here. I want to pick you up and put you in my pack, where it's a bit safer. I have some peanuts too!~

@716=~Its eyes brighten with the mention of food and it swiftly jumps into her arms. "All right, you have me." It crawls inside her pack, while chewing the nuts.~

@717=~The rabbit looks at you with suspicion, and after a moment's inspection, it turns and gives you full view of its rear while it strolls to Jan. He claims it's a polymorphed lich, however, there is nothing in its behavior, that would indicate that.~

@718=~The rabbit sighs, its nose twitching slightly as it looks up to Jan. "What is it now?"~

@719=~You know, you are awfully grumpy, even for a polymorphed lich.~

@720=~The rabbit sighs again. "I am not a lich, Jan. Just give me a piece of turnip and I'll be on my way."~

@721=~Come here now. I want to pick you up and put you in my pack. It's not good for your old bones to jump around all day long.~

@722=~The rabbit gives Jan a resigned look and slowly crawls inside his pack.~

@723=~The small dragon-like creature purrs quizzically with wide eyes. Nervously, it backs away towards Nalia. Obviously, it doesn't want to talk to you.~

@724=~The small dragon-like creature flutters its wings happily, looking at Nalia with almost kaleidoscopic eyes. "You wish something?" It awaits her attention, tail flicking.~

@725=~Come here. I want to pick you up and put you in my pack, where it's a bit safer.~

@726=~Its eyes brighten, and it practically leaps into her arms, ready to be stowed amongst her belongings, where it can sleep and occasionally poke its head out.~

@727=~Neera's cat looks at you with suspicion, and after a moment's inspection, it turns and gives you full view of its rear while it strolls to her.~

@728=~The cat flicks its tail, its nose twitching slightly with curiosity as it looks up with dark eyes. "What is it, girl?"~

@729=~Come here. I want to pick you up and put you in my pack, where it's a bit safer.~

@730=~Milo eyes her pack, and then reluctantly crawls inside. "Very well. It is better that you carry me. Do not bump me around so much this time though."~

@731=~The little creature looks at you with suspicion, and after a moment's inspection, it turns and gives you full view of its rear while it strolls to Yoshimo.~

@732=~The grounhog straightens up, its nose twitching slightly with curiosity as it looks up with dark eyes. "What is it, master Yoshimo?"~

@733=~Come here. I want to pick you up and put you in my pack, where it's a bit safer.~

@755=~The spider looks at you with hostility, seemingly ready to attack you at any moment. Only when Baeloth commands it, it looses interest in your presence and runs to him.~

@756=~The spider stands without any movement in absolute obedience. "What do you wish of me, my Master?"~

@757=~Come here. You're going in my pack for now.~

@758=~It reacts readily, and crawls inside. "As you command".~

@759=~The small dragon-like creature purrs quizzically with wide eyes. Nervously, it backs away towards Dynaheir. Obviously, it doesn't want to talk to you.~

@760=~The small dragon-like creature flutters its wings happily, looking at Dynaheir with almost kaleidoscopic eyes. "You wish something?" It awaits her attention, tail flicking.~

@761=~Come here. I want to pick you up and put you in my pack, where it's a bit safer.~

@762=~Its eyes brighten, and it practically leaps into her arms, ready to be stowed amongst her belongings, where it can sleep and occasionally poke its head out.~

@763=~The imp stares with open derision, sticking out its forked tongue rudely. It scoots off to Eldoth. Obviously, it doesn't want to talk to you...~

@764=~The impish creature regards Eldoth suspiciously, wary of a kick or slap headed its way, before sidling a step or two closer. "Yeah, boss? You want something?"~

@767=~The little creature looks at you with suspicion, and after a moment's inspection, it turns and gives you full view of its rear while it strolls to Garrick.~

@768=~The rabbit attentively straightens up, its nose twitching slightly with curiosity as it looks up with dark eyes. "What is it, master Garrick?"~

@769=~Come here. I want to pick you up and put you in my pack, where it's a bit safer.~

@770=~It eyes his pack, and after a moment crawls inside. "All right. It is better that you carry me."~

@771=~The little creature looks at you with suspicion, and after a moment's inspection, it turns and gives you full view of its rear while it strolls to Khalid.~

@772=~The grounhog hops happily as it looks up to Khalid. "You wish something?" It awaits his attention.~

@773=~Come here. I want to pick you up and put you in my pack, where it's a bit safer.~

@776=~The Lim-Lim looks up at Quayle. "Piyo! Piyo!" Its wings buzz happily when it realizes he is paying attention to it. "Piyo!"~

@777=~Hehehe, yes. Come here. I want to pick you up and put you in my pack, where it's a bit safer.~

@778=~"Piyo! Piyo!" The Lim-Lim bounces about merrily, its wings buzzing. It crawls inside his pack.~

@779=~The small dragon-like creature looks at you distinguishly with its wide eyes. After a moment, it slightly pretentiously turns around and head towards Safana. Obviously, it doesn't want to talk to you.~

@780=~The dragon flicks its tail and flutters its wings with anticipation as it looks up with almost kaleidoscopic eyes. "What is it, Safana?"~

@781=~Come here girl. I want to pick you up and put you in my pack, where it's a bit safer.~

@782=~It eyes her pack, and then reluctantly crawls inside. "Very well. It is better that you carry me. Do not bump me around so much this time though."~

@783=~Xan's familiar gives you a resigned look. After a moment's inspection, it turns and, obviously bored, strolls back to him.~

@784=~The mephit sighs, and as it looks up to Xan, they both share a depressed look for a moment. "What is it, my master?"~

@785=~Come here. I want to pick you up and put you in my pack, where it's a bit safer.~

@786=~It sighs again and slowly crawls inside his pack. "Very well."~

@787=~A human skull, levitating in the air before you, watches you with its empty eye sockets. It's apparently amused. A force, which keeps it above ground appears to be unknown, but makes you uneasy. After a while, its interest in you fades and it turns back to Xzar. You are relieved.~

@788=~The skull turns to Xzar, its eye sockets watching his every unpredictable movement with great interest. "What do you wish from Shammuabu'nechazz, my dear friend?"~

@789=~I want to share with you my latest master plan. Listen carefully.~

@790=~After Xzar secretively whispers his ideas, following with occasional mad laughter, the skull stops to think. "Hmm, I can cook a spell or two for that, I'll need some time though."~

@791=~Come to me then my friend. I will carry you now.~

@792=~It flies inside his backpack, looking for appropriate space for it to concentrate. After a moment, it settles in. "All right, don't disturb me now."~

@884=~This mysteriously glowing spherical artifact is one of the famous shifting stones, rare jewels imbued with powerful teleportation magic. It belonged to an amnian archmage Mallon Eqoa, a pioneer of mass warping techniques, whose passion led him to an unfortunate fate.

Mallon's vision was a world made prosperous by an instant global trade and permanent interconnection of its population. His ideas included broadly distributed magical stones, that would allow instant traveling. So, he sought a way to contain a powerful magic within a convenient shape, to be easily used by untrained, common people. It is said, that during one of his experiments, he was pulled into a multi-dimensional vortex and his body was shred to pieces. Such is the fate of pioneers.

Everything that was left of his work were few functioning prototypes with a regional range. The only thing, that his followers were able do, was to give his creations fancy names. This one is called a "Shifting Heart" and is allegedly Mallon's most favourite, because it allowed him to travel over his homeland.
